# Kingman, Arizona 1953

North-west of Kingman Arizona, USA on May 20th 1953.

Initially investigated by Raymond E. Fowler for NICAP.

Purportedly recovered by [Project Pounce](../../projects/pounce.md) [Schratt 2010].

[R. Geldreich](https://medium.com/@richgel99/crash-retrieval-leak-timeline-4b75b8ef529a):

> The main witness to the Kingman AZ area C/R in the literature was **Arthur Glenn (or Glen) Stansel Jr**.,
> 6 Nov 1924 (Dayton, Montgomery County, Ohio, USA) to 3 Dec 2006 (aged 82, New Ipswich, Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, USA).
> His last name is sometimes misspelled in some literature as “Stancil”.
> He signed a legal affidavit vouching to the honesty of his testimony, which I’m working on tracking down.

According to aerospace engineer [Spaulding](https://rense.com/general13/historic_ciasurvel.htm):

> Mr. Spaulding said he has sworn statements from retired Air Force colonels that at least two U.F.O.'s have crashed landed and have been recovered by the Air Force.
> 
> One crash, he said, was in Mexico in 1948 and the other was near Kingman, Ariz., in 1953.
> He said the retired officers claimed they got a glimpse of dead aliens who were in both cases about
> four feet tall with silverish complexions and wearing silver outfits that "seemed fused to the body from the heat."
