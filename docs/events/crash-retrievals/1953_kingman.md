The specific number of living and dead pilots varies between reports.

# Witnesses

The main witness is Arthur G.Stansel (pseudonym Fritz Werner) [who says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4CvjWEB6C8):

> He had seen two bodies inside this tent. Two alien, queer-looking bodies.
> It was brown, leathery skin. Silver cap on without a bill like a skill cap.

[R. Geldreich](https://medium.com/@richgel99/crash-retrieval-leak-timeline-4b75b8ef529a):

> The main witness to the Kingman AZ area C/R in the literature was **Arthur Glenn (or Glen) Stansel Jr**.,
> 6 Nov 1924 (Dayton, Montgomery County, Ohio, USA) to 3 Dec 2006 (aged 82, New Ipswich, Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, USA).
> His last name is sometimes misspelled in some literature as “Stancil”.
> He signed a legal affidavit vouching to the honesty of his testimony, which I’m working on tracking down.

According to aerospace engineer [Spaulding](https://rense.com/general13/historic_ciasurvel.htm):

> Mr. Spaulding said he has sworn statements from retired Air Force colonels that at least two U.F.O.'s have crashed landed and have been recovered by the Air Force.
> 
> One crash, he said, was in Mexico in 1948 and the other was near Kingman, Ariz., in 1953.
> He said the retired officers claimed they got a glimpse of dead aliens who were in both cases about
> four feet tall with silverish complexions and wearing silver outfits that "seemed fused to the body from the heat." 

Leonard Stringfield also investigated [this event](https://www.thinkaboutitdocs.com/1953-may-20-kingman-arizona-ufo-crash/), or a similar crash:

> Curiously, Leonard Stringfield, who re-opened the case for crash-retrievals, mentioned testimony he had gotten from a Naval Intelligence
> Officer who had seen bodies from a crash that occurred in the Arizona desert in 1953. He viewed the bodies at Wright-Patterson when the
> crates arrived at night aboard a DC-7. There were five crates in all, three of which contained little humanoids about four feet tall.
> Their heads were hairless and disproportionately large with skin that looked brown under the hangar lights.
> They were wearing tight-fitting dark suits.
> It has been suggested by some researchers that these bodies could have come from the crash mentioned by Stancil.

Bill Uhouse claimed that several beings were recovered:

> Engineer Bill Uhouse claims there was a crash of an Ebans (Ebens) aerial craft near Kingman, Arizona in 1953 and that four entities survived.
> That would have been six years after the more famous Roswell crashes and retrievals of “interplanetary craft of unknown origin.”
> In Kingman, according to Uhouse, two disabled Ebens and two more that were in good condition were retrieved by U. S.government units
> specially trained for retrieval missions.
