> Dan maintained his interest in the planet Mars all through his educational
years, and by the time the government reentered his life, some of his ideas
about the planet had already attracted some notice at NASA. In 1982, when
he was about seventeen, until 1985, he set himself up as the owner of Crain
Environmental Research in Las Vegas. Under the auspices of this
organizational title, heavy with global implications, he submitted a report to
NASA entitled, “On the Transplantation of Protozoa and the Exploitation of
Martian Exobiology, the Case for Euglena Vindis in the Automated
Biological Laboratory.” Not exactly your typical teenage essay.

> NASA’s reply to his paper stated, “Your project has been found to contain
sufficient intrinsic merit as to enable integration into NSCORT RT Bio-
regenerative Life Support Division, a sub-directorate of the Controlled
Ecological Life Support Systems (CELSS) Program of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.” So, at least in this small way, Dan
had been noticed by the government long before his formal education was
completed.
