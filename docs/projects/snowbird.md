# Project Snowbird

From the [Project Aquarius](aquarius.md) [Executive Briefing](../documents/aquarius_briefing.md):

> Originally established in 1972.
> Its mission was to test fly a recovered Alien aircraft.
> This project is continuing in Nevada.
> {OPR: [USAF](../organisations/usaf.md)/[NASA](../organisations/nasa.md)/[CIA](../organisations/cia.md)/[MJ12](../organisations/mj12.md)}

According to this anonymous article about Lee Graham's research:

>  The one interesting point that arose is when [John Andrews of the Testor Corporation] used the word *Snowbird* (the rumored UFO back-engineering project in Nevada). [Lockheed Skunkworks director Ben Rich] simply replied, “If I were to use that word I would be in jail.”
