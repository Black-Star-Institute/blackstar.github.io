According to [McDowell](https://projectcamelotportal.com/2008/01/04/dan-burisch-summary/):

> Dan became familiar with a project called ‘Looking Glass’ which involved a back-engineered Extraterrestrial device originally
> designed to be a portal opening mechanism for Stargate-type travel – which had (has) the capacity to bend time/space so that
> events over the forward and rear event horizons could be viewed. When it is paired up with a second device using the settings,
> events can not only be viewed but heard and more. This device was also being tested for communications protocols and
> transportation applications as recently as 2003-2004 before being dismantled for safety reasons as we enter further into the
> highly energetic space in and around the galactic plane.
