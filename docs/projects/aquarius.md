# Project Aquarius

Formerly Project GLEEM.

Project Aquarius was an umbrella term for various secret projects involving research into UFOnauts at Area 51.

Burisch [claims](https://web.archive.org/web/20210925062617/https://paolaharris.com/home-page/interview-with-micro-biologist-dr-dan-burisch) that the project was named after the home of the P-52 J-RODs.

> Aquarius Constellation: Gleise 876C. That is the origin of the name for Project Aquarius.
