# Ganesh particle

This is possibly something to do with panspermia and the origin of life.

> The Ganesh Particle, under the correct electrical impulse levels, was observed being liberated from the crystalline rock.  It is currently believed that the Ganesh Particle is a dense collection of electromagnetic waves, containing information, and floating in a river of less dense electromagnetism.

# Frenchman Mountain

Chi'el'a told Burisch the location where he could find *Ganesh particle(s)* at [Frenchman mountain](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uqd9vDmfUZKXHXHR9) near Las Vegas, USA.

> [Burisch] hypothesized that perhaps one of the reasons the life-programming ganesh particles were at the Frenchman Mountain site was because he and his colleagues had also discovered an Einstein-Rosen Bridge (ERB) wormhole there on the mountain which might have originally transported the ganesh particles from Somewhere Else in the universe.
