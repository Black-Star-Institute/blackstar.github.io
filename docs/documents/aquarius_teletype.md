# Aquarius Teletype

This is a purported secret document that is associated with the [Project Aquarius Executive Briefing](aquarius_briefing.md) that was given to William Moore in February 1981.

> It is believed that this is a retyped Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) document that Bill Moore received. Although the focus of the controversy is around the Aquarius project, Paul Bennewitz, and the film that is discussed in the document, the comment about MJ â€“ TWELVE is secondary and off hand to the whole teletype.

Apparently, "there is an excellent 8 page write up from [International UFO Reporter](https://cufos.org/cufos-publications-databases/iur/) (IUR) about the authenticity of this document". Which volume contains this article?
