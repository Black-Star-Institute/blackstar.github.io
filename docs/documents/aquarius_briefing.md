AKA Aquarius fax and briefing. This is a purported top secret 11-page document that describes [Project Aquarius](../projects/aquarius.md) and indirectly confirms the existence of [Majestic 12](../organisations/mj12). It refers to further classified information abut UFOs and Identified Alien Crafts (IACs).

It is associated with the [Aquarius Teletype](aquarius_teletype.md).

# Authenticity

This document is not considered to be authentic with a high degree of confidence. According to Ryan Wood, it has less than 40% probability of being genuine. [Wood]

> This eleven page document is the product of Bill Moore’s photography in some obscure East Coast hotel room according to his story. The content is fascinating but difficult to check; mentions of the ETs being from Zeta Reticuli is consistent with earlier work by Marjorie Fish.

> [The document] is an actual example of some of the disinformation produced in connection with the Bennewitz case. The document is a retyped version of a real AFOSI message with a few spurious additions.
