# Wilson-Davis notes

Eric W. Davis wrote these notes following a purported conversation with Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson (retired) in 2002.

The documents emerged in 2016 from the estate of astronaut Edgar Mitchell. They were leaked on the internet in 2019.

Richard Dolan believes these are “the most significant leak of UFO-related documents in many years”.

If authentic, they confirm the existence of secret American "black programs" that conceal UFO materials and knowledge outside of normal oversight.
