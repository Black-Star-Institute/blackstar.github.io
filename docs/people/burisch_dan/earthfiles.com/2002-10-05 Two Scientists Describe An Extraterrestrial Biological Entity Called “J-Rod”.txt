Part 1 – Two Scientists Describe An Extraterrestrial Biological Entity Called “J-Rod”



­ Born 1924.
­ Ten years fighter pilot in the U. S. Marine Corps.
­ Fought in last part of WWII and Korean War.
­ Honorable discharge as Marine Corps Captain.
­ 1954-1958, employed as civilian mechanical engineer by U.S. Air Force at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio, to do experimental flight testing on various modified aircraft. Also asked to work on a “flying disc simulator” through a commercial civilian company called A-Link Aviation which manufactured simulators.
­ 1958-1988, worked on “flying disc simulators” in which certain U.S. Air Force pilots trained. First functional simulator in 1958, copied from a “30-meter-diameter extraterrestrial craft retrieved in 1952 or 1953 from Kingman, Arizona.”
­ Retired and living in Nevada.

“Part of Bill’s story was that the technical knowledge, the physics, for these particular reverse engineered craft came from an extraterrestrial biological entity (Eben) which he said was ‘J-Rod.’ The entity was once said to have drawn a symbol that looked like our letter ‘J,’ followed by a straight line that looked like a rod.

THAT IS SUPPOSED TO STAND FOR WHAT?

We don’t know what it stands for. Initially we took it to mean this was just some kind of a name that they gave this entity. In other words, instead of just saying, ‘Hey, you!’ they called him J-Rod. What Bill Uhouse said initially is that this J-Rod is kind of head of the (flying saucer simulator) project.

THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER IN WHICH INSTALLATION?

Bill said he worked in two places: one was Los Alamos, New Mexico, and the other was at Site 4 (S-4), Papoose Mountain, Groom Lake, Nevada.

WHERE WAS J-ROD SUPPOSED TO BE BASED?

This is how we started to learn that J-Rod was a designation for this type of entity because it turns out there were at least two J-Rods, at least two. Maybe more. But, the two J-Rods were located – one was at Los Alamos (National Laboratory) and the other – as we know now – was located in an environmental sphere inside an installation known as Site 4, or some call it Sector 4. But it’s Site 4 within Papoose Mountain itself.

AT AREA 51?

In that general area.

DID BILL UHOUSE DESCRIBE HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO J-ROD WHEN J-ROD WAS COMMUNICATING?

All I remember was that he was in the same room with him.

DID HE REMEMBER ANY KIND OF ODOR?

I don’t recall that he mentioned that, no.

DID HE EVER TOUCH J-ROD’S SKIN?

I don’t recall that he touched him, no.

J-ROD WAS ABOUT HOW HIGH?

Somewhere around 4 foot 9 and 5 feet tall.

AND HE HAD REPTILIAN EYES?

I don’t know. The way he drew them, he had those dark, tear drop, large black lenses, or whatever they are?

COVERINGS.

Coverings. So, I don’t think he had any direct look at the eyes.

SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT WHAT’S UNDERNEATH THOSE DARK LENSES LIKE SUNGLASSES ARE YELLOW EYES WITH VERTICAL PUPILS. THAT’S WHY I WONDERED.

I cannot confirm that as regards J-Rod.

YOU AND I HAVE EXCHANGED A DRAWING THAT IS IDENTIFIED AS J-ROD.

Yes, that is the one that was drawn by Bill Uhouse.
Drawing of J-Rod by mechanical engineer, Bill Uhouse, based on J-Rod's appearance dressed in a human man's shirt in 1970s or early 1980s at a conference table with physicist Edward Teller and eighteen scientists, including Uhouse. The project that linked Uhouse to J-Rod was a "flying saucer simulator" to teach certain U. S. Air Force pilots to fly back-engineered, and/or actual, extraterrestrial craft.

THE BEING WAS WEARING A MAN’S SHIRT. WHEN UHOUSE DREW THAT, WHAT WAS HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE EBEN KNOWN AS J-ROD?

The only relationship was that Uhouse was part of the project team where J-Rod was an advisor in terms of what he might need to know technically.

Scientific Meetings Lead by J-Rod and Physicist Edward Teller

THAT UHOUSE WOULD HAVE TO KNOW TECHNICALLY?

Yes. Apparently, Bill Uhouse was in attendance at a conference table with a number of scientists at Los Alamos. At one end of the table was the head of the project which by name, according to Uhouse, was Dr. Edward Teller. At the other end of the table was J-Rod. In attendance around the conference table, I guess, were 18 scientists and engineers.

WHAT YEAR WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?

Not sure of the year. It might date back as far as the 1970s, or early 1980s. But I’m not sure.

AT THIS TABLE IN WHICH J-ROD IS PRESIDING WITH EDWARD TELLER WHO MOST OF US KNOW WAS DIRECTOR OF THE STAR WARS PROGRAM UNDER THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION ­ AND IF THIS WAS IN THE 1970S, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE REAGAN STAR WARS PROGRAM ­ WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT BETWEEN J-ROD, THE CONFERENCE TABLE OF SCIENTISTS AND EDWARD TELLER?

I have no idea. That wasn’t disclosed to me. I wish I knew! But Bill said it was quite a scene (laughs).

IT WOULD SEEM THAT DESCRIBING A MEETING WITH EDWARD TELLER AND SCIENTISTS AND AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY DRESSED IN A HUMAN SHIRT IN THE 1970S WOULD CERTAINLY BE WORTH GOING INTO GREAT DETAIL ABOUT WHAT WAS BEING DISCUSSED AND WHAT THE EBEN WAS SAYING.

You have to realize that Bill came out with a story in the 1990s and he did it in talks that he gave that were probably limited to about one hour. And when he began to speak publicly, he said that his supervisors or managers or whoever they were ­ I believe they were two different men from the National Security Agency (NSA) ­ had OK’d his (Bill Uhouse) saying some of this in public.

DID HE EXPLAIN WHY?

I guess he thought perhaps the managers wanted to see how this all would fly in public and whether anybody would believe him. He was one of seven trained individuals who could work on the flying saucer simulator, build it and test it. I have a drawing somewhere of what that simulator looked like drawn by Glenn Campbell, another Area 51 investigator.

In September 1996, Area 51 investigator, Glenn Campbell, interviewed Bill Uhouse who he referred to as "Jarod 2." Working with Uhouse's direction, Campbell drew the UFO simulator graphics above © 1996.

WHAT SPECIFICALLY DID BILL UHOUSE SAY IT WAS LIKE TO BE IN J-ROD’S PHYSICAL PRESENCE?

To be in his physical presence, namely he said that what was odd was J-Rod’s way of communicating and that was, if Uhouse had a question on his mind, J-Rod would answer the question in his (Uhouse’s) mind, using his own voice.

YOU’RE TALKING NOW ABOUT TELEPATHY IN WHICH BILL UHOUSE WOULD HEAR HIS OWN THOUGHT VOICE IN HIS MIND, BUT IT WAS BEING PROVOKED BY THE NON-HUMAN NAMED J-ROD?

Yes. As far as Uhouse’s own thought voice, I don’t know it was audible or inaudible. (SEE: Part 2 for Uhouse’s own description which does seem to describe audible Q & A with J-Rod.)

THE IDEA WAS THAT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY (EBEN) WITH ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE WOULD HELP OUR GOVERNMENT BUILD SIMULATORS TO TEACH AMERICAN PILOTS HOW TO FLY DISC-SHAPED EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT?

Essentially. In fact, not just from Uhouse, but from multiple sources, they paint a picture that we have established some kind of exchange, scientific exchange program, with these Ebens. This program has been going on since, I think it was established sometime around the mid-1960s and has been going on since that time with the arrival of a being they designated as EBE 2. Then, after EBE 2, one of the beings that arrived was EBE 3 and it was supposedly EBE 3 that had two assistants that have different specialties or special knowledge and these were the J-Rods.

Zeta Reticulii 1 and 2 and Gliese 876-c Star Systems

DID HE HAVE ANY IMPRESSION FROM J-ROD ABOUT J-ROD’S PLANET OR THE WAY J-ROD LIVED WHEN HE WAS NOT IN THE CONFINES OF LOS ALAMOS OR AREA 51?

No. He mentioned that J-Rod was originally from the Zeta Reticulum system.

ZETA RETICULII I AND II, THE BINARY SYSTEM?

Yes.
The yellow binary star system Zeta Reticulii 1 and 2 is about 37 light years from Earth. Both suns are similar to the Earth's sun. The distance between the binary stars is estimated to be nearly 100 times the distance from Pluto to our sun. Thus, a solar system around one star is not expected to disturb another solar system around the second star.

Thus, a solar system around one star is not expected to disturb another solar system around the second star.

WHAT IS J-ROD AND HIS SPECIES, KIND, CIVILIZATION – WHAT ARE THEY DOING ON EARTH IN THE FIRST PLACE?

Actually, I gained more information from Dr. Dan Burisch when I discussed this with him.”

Part 2 – J-Rod and Microbiologist Dan B. Burisch, Ph.D.

“WHAT DID DAN BURISCH SAY ABOUT THE ZETA RETICULII SYSTEM?

Well, he did mention that what he saw in the documents was that the J-Rod type beings were originally from a planet around one of the Zeta Reticulii stars and that it, I believe, I don’t recall exactly ­ but it had a longer diurnal cycle than the earth. I’m not sure it was. It had a longer annual period in its orbit around the sun.

Dr. Burisch told me that the J-Rods and other blond humanoid types used the star, Gliese 876-c, as a kind of remote camp to study the earth. He told me that, ‘Gliese 876-c is the only one I have been given information about. It is not what we would consider habitable. However, it is the location that they selected for their remote staging base, the one that they use in a cooperative effort to study and interact with us. It was described to me as being below the cloudy surface layer, as this planet appears to have a great deal of gas on the surface. The rationale behind this is that both Zeta Reticulii and Sirius/Orion (Epsilon Orionis star system) were too far to keep going back to. They needed to conserve energy and time, so they established a cooperative base. When they need to return home, they use the Gliese 876-c as a jump-gate back to their respective solar systems.’
Gliese 876-c, Red Dwarf in Constellation Aquarius Distance from Sun: 15.4 Light Years Right Ascension: 22 53 15.6 Declination: -14 15 40 Spectral Type: M4 V Apparent Magnitude: 10.17 Mass: 1.89 Solar Masses Radius: -1 Solar Radii
Gliese 876-c, Red Dwarf in Constellation Aquarius
Distance from Sun: 15.4 Light Years
Right Ascension: 22 53 15.6
Declination: -14 15 40
Spectral Type: M4 V
Apparent Magnitude: 10.17
Mass: 1.89 Solar Masses
Radius: -1 Solar Radii

I know that Gliese 876-c has a wobble.

WHICH MEANS IT HAS PLANETS.

It has planets and apparently Gliese 876-c is where J-Rod actually transferred his home base to in order to get more easily to earth. And it’s maybe 15 to 16 light years from earth. In other words, it’s closer (than Zeta Reticulii which is 37.5 light years from earth). But I understand it’s not a planet that is, in our terms, habitable. So, they must have made an artificial habitat of some kind there.

J-Rods Trying To Alter Earth Time Line

According to Dr. Burisch, the EBENs are here to try to alter our time lines, our future. The reason for this is that they, according to him as fantastic as it sounds, they travel in time. So, they already know, or they know as a memory, what happened here. There is a coming catastrophe that drastically reduces the population of the earth and splits the earth into two populations and these two populations isolated from each other evolve from what we know as Homo sapiens into two different species.

ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY KNOW FROM OUR PAST TIME LINE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ASTEROID AND COMETARY DESTRUCTIONS OF THIS EARTH AND THEY HAVE GONE INTO THE FUTURE AND THEY SEE ANOTHER SIMILAR DESTRUCTION?

What I’m saying is that they evolved in our future, according to the Doctrine of the Convergent Time Lines. In other words, they come from our future and they have traveled backwards to our past – or our current present.

THEY ARE COMING BACK BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO PREVENT SOME TYPE OF CATASTROPHE?

They are trying to alter the time line, yes. Apparently, whatever genetic traits this J-Rod inherited, they are suffering from some kind of defective gene which has caused neural degeneration in their system or what Dr. Burisch calls a “peripheral neuropathy.” In fact, Dan was given the task of looking into the possibility of genetic reverse engineering to repair the Eben’s degenerate system.

IS THE IMPLICATION THAT IF THEY CAME INTO THE HOMO SAPIENS FUTURE AT SOME POINT IN THE FAR DISTANCE, THAT THEY ARE NOW REACHING BACK INTO OUR GENETIC BLOODLINES FOR GENETIC MATERIAL THAT THEY THINK MIGHT HELP THEM IN SOME WAY?

From what I understand, they are an altered form, a new species, that branched off Homo sapiens.

IN WHAT WAS A CATASTROPHE OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL OUR FUTURE?

Yes.

DID DAN BURISCH HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE CATASTROPHE IS IN THE COMING FUTURE?

He cannot specifically say what occurred. However, he places it as happening approximately a decade from now.

Global Catastrophe and Human Depopulation in 2012?

IN THAT 2012 TIME PERIOD THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE END OF THE MAYAN GRAND CALENDAR?

Yes. But it is not rigidly fixed. It could happen any time between now and then, or even a little past that time. I’m not certain whether it is something that is an instant cataclysmic event of some kind. I have no idea. But of course, all of this is subject to – we’re going to find out one way or another. If we do have one of these catastrophes, that means they did not succeed in altering the time line, right? But if it does not occur, we can say either the information was false, which of course skeptics will say instantly. Or we can say they did succeed in their program of altering the time lines and averting a catastrophe.

AVERTING A CATASTROPHE, IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU’VE SAID, WOULD ESSENTIALLY KILL OFF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR PARTICULAR SPECIES LINE AT LEAST IN A TIME LINE THAT THE EARTH WOULD CONTINUE ON. BECAUSE IF THERE IS NO CATASTROPHE, THERE WOULD BE NO BRANCHING OFF THAT WOULD HAVE PRODUCED THE SPECIES COMING BACK TO AVERT THE CATASTROPHE?

The thing is that there are groups of humans – who these groups are, I don’t know – who survived by going underground.

IN THIS ALLEGED FUTURE CATASTROPHE.

Exactly, to shelter themselves from the effects of the catastrophe.

J-Rods, A Homo sapiens Species From The Future Now Moved Out To Zeta Reticulii 1 and 2, Gliese 876-c and Epsilon Orionis?

YOU’RE SAYING THAT THESE UNDERGROUND EVOLVING SPECIES ARE WHAT BECAME THE J-RODS THAT ENDED UP ON ZETA RETICULII 1 AND 2 AND THE OTHER SYSTEMS?

Yes. That’s according to what Dr. Dan Burisch recalls reading in the briefing document.

THAT’S WHY THERE WOULD BE SOME COMMON DENOMINATOR TO GENETIC MATERIAL ON THE EARTH AND WHY IT WOULD BE VALUABLE TO THEM?

Exactly. And that would explain why the Greys are attempting hybridization and gathering genetic material.

IN YOUR MIND, ARE GREY BEINGS ONE AND THE SAME AS THE J-ROD SPECIES?

J-Rod is at least one species of grey type being. I believe because of other descriptions, that there are other extraterrestrial types as well.

SO THESE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN AT LOS ALAMOS AND AREA 51 AND WHO KNOWS WHERE ELSE, THEY WOULD BE COMFORTABLE BEING HERE IN THE SENSE THAT WHATEVER WORK THEY DO TO HELP US WOULD BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TO THEM AND US IN SOME FAR FLUNG FUTURE?

Exactly. That would explain their motives for what they do. The explanation for why it is kept so secret is, I guess, you just don’t want to announce to the world at large that we’re headed toward some kind of future catastrophe and unless we avert this catastrophe, a large percentage of the population is going to be eradicated. I mean, you just don’t want to tell people that.

Worldwide Animal Mutilations

HOW WOULD ANIMAL MUTILATIONS PLAY INTO ALL OF THIS?

The only thing I could determine is that there is something in the (food) formula that these Greys use because they no longer ingest food through their mouth and take it through the alimentary canal to digest it. Instead, they absorb the nutrients through their skin.

NOW, IS THIS SOMETHING DAN BURISCH HAS CONFIRMED HE HAS KNOWLEDGE OF?

Yes, in fact, he even gave me a name for the process. I don’t recall what it was.

SO, THIS OLD STORY FROM THE 1980s ABOUT A GREY SPECIES OF NON-HUMANS PAINTING THEIR SKINS WITH BLOOD AND TISSUE FROM ANIMALS TO ABSORB IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE TRUE, ACCORDING TO DR. DAN BURISCH?

Yes. Not only Dan Burisch, but other sources have given me this very same information – including a retired Marine Sergeant who was active in crash retrievals.

WHAT DID HE SAY?

He said the same thing, but he called it ‘osmosis.’ When I mentioned osmosis to Dan who is a microbiologist, he said, ‘That is not exactly the process.’ Then he gave it a name. I’m sorry I wasn’t prepared and did not write it down because it was technical. I’ll have to ask him again.

IS IT YOUR IMPRESSION FROM THE MILITARY MAN AND DAN BURISCH THAT THE COLLECTING, OR HARVESTING, OF THE TISSUE AND FLUID FROM ANIMALS AROUND THE WORLD FOR HALF A CENTURY OR MORE IS A KIND OF FOOD GATHERING PROCESS FOR THESE BEINGS?

Apparently. The hemoglobin is used in that formula that they use for nutrition.

THAT THEY PUT ON THEIR SKIN.

Right.

THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER REASON WHY THESE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES COULD NOT MIX WITH HUMAN CIVILIZATION VERY EASILY.

That’s true! Also, at least the J-Rod kind needs to breathe a different atmosphere.

AT LOS ALAMOS AND AREA 51, THEY HAD A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE TO LIVE IN?

They have these special (YY-II) facilities to house them, environmental facilities. Even EBE 2 was kept in a special environmental facility.

 

J-Rod Upset At Being A “Captive” In S-4, Papoose Mountain Range

Dan Burisch had an incident in which he entered the environmental sphere one time. He was supposed to go through a protocol and raise his right hand and say, ‘I am a friendly human being who has come to conduct this procedure,’ and then state what the procedure was. He thought that was silly because he was already in communication with the J-Rod before entering the sphere. Well, one time he entered this sphere and J-Rod came up and kind of grabbed him. Dan was in a suit with hoses coming out of the suit.

DAN IS SUITED UP BECAUSE HE IS GOING INTO THIS UNUSUAL ATMOSPHERE THAT J-ROD LIVES IN?

Right. And J-Rod grabbed him and circled his long arms around Dan’s suit (apparently upset at being a ‘captive” in S-4?)
Drawing by Dan Burisch, Ph.D., of J-Rod suddenly encircling the microbiologist with his long arms inside the special environmental sphere inside the Papoose Mountain S-4 facility. Many images and thoughts flooded Dr. Burisch's mind until he lost consciousness. Some of those thoughts were "Look into the eyes of your own brother." "A new heaven, a new earth?" "Find love." The residue of the experience in Dr. Burisch's mind was J-Rod's frustration at being held a "captive" by a "brother" human, linked through past, present and future time lines.

When J-Rod does that and is in that close contact with Dan, Burisch starts to lose awareness of his surroundings because his mind is being flooded with images. As images flood his mind, at some point he passed out.

DOES HE REMEMBER WHAT THE IMAGES WERE?

He has attempted to draw them, but unfortunately he’s not the artist that Bill Uhouse was. He has attempted to make drawings of these images.

WHAT WERE THEY?

One was an image of J-Rod as he perceives himself and calls himself a ‘captive.’ Then there were other scenes that would be seen in an off-world environment. One scene looked like a spacecraft. These were all jumbled up together along with some thoughts. One of the thoughts he strongly got was, ‘You are looking at the face of your brother!’

YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE FACE OF YOUR BROTHER.

Right.

AND THAT MEANS DAN BURISCH TO J-ROD.

It was overwhelming, apparently. Dan collapsed from either exhaustion or whatever debilitating state he was in from this encounter.

WHEN HE WOKE UP, WHERE WAS HE?

I guess they had removed him from the sphere and he was in the infirmary or whatever they have there. They do have quarters that people can stay in (at S-4, Papoose Mountain, Groom Lake near Area 51 and Nellis AFB, Nevada.)

 

Current Relationship Between EBEN J-Rods and Earth Humans

WE’RE TALKING NOW IN OCTOBER 2002, DO YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT J-ROD IS STILL WORKING WITH OUR SCIENTISTS INSIDE OF THE PAPOOSE MOUNTAIN FACILITY AND AT LOS ALAMOS AND PERHAPS OTHER LOCATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY?

No, because in November 1994, EBE 3’s visit came to an end. EBE 3 took the assistant J-Rod from Los Alamos and was to take the one from Papoose and return to home planet, now Gliese. What happened is that EBE 3 left with only one J-Rod and the one (at Papoose) was held back for further studies, I guess. Whatever this agreement is, the negotiated agreement, is up for renewal, according to Dan, next year. It’s renewed every 9 years. So, EBE 3 is due to return next year to renegotiate the contract or agreement. But since the J-Rod was left here for further study and considers himself captive and not free to come and go, I am just wondering what will happen when he (EBE 3) does return?

YES.

Now, there are only a few of these that are working with our secret government here and the rest go about their own business. They don’t even cooperate with our government.

MEANING FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE, THAT THERE ARE OTHER EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT AT ALL INVOLVED WITH THE J-ROD/EBEN EFFORT TO ADJUST TIME LINES AND TO AVERT SOME ANNIHILATION IN THE FUTURE AND SAVE OURSELVES AND THEMSELVES?

They (others) are going on their own agendas, even if they are among the J-Rods themselves. What I’m saying, the greater population of these J-Rod entities does NOT associate or cooperate with our government. Perhaps it is for this reason that our government is worried about what they may do, what their plan is because what we’re not intimately associated with, we can’t control. I can just say that I don’t know what the political organization is that these J-Rods have, what the nature of it, or how they negotiate these agreements or why there are those who do not agree. All of these are big question marks.

 

2003, 2012 and the Committee of the Majority (MJ-12)

2003 IS A BIG QUESTION MARK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT?

Yes. There is something significant about 2003, according to other sources that I have, but I have not been able to determine what that significance is. Also, trying to sort out all this information, I do not assume that the information I gather is misinformation unless it shows up as falsified. I just assume that it is information that may be true or false and only further analysis and time will tell.

Some of this makes sense. That’s the part that gets to me. There is an intimate relationship here with the human race because they are related to us, makes sense.

ARE THE PEOPLE OR OFFICE IN CHARGE OF OVERSEEING HIS WORK (BURISCH) AND REQUISITIONING EVERYTHING HE NEEDS AS A SCIENTIST RELATED TO MJ-12?

Yes, but it goes up ­ the actual authority that he gets approval from, he calls the Committee of the Majority.

THE COMMITTEE OF THE MAJORITY?

Right.

DOES HE REFER TO THEM AS MAJORITY 12?

No. When he refers to Majestic, he just calls them Majestic.

HE DOES KNOW MJ-12 AS A WORKING ACRONYM?

Yes. And on his badge was ‘MAJI.’

WHO DOES HE PERCEIVE THAT MAJI REPORTS TO?

The top authority that he reports to are the members of the Committee of the Majority. But the top independent person, individual, that he used to report to back in the early 1990s was this Vice Admiral J. M. McConnell who was head of the NSA.

HEAD OF THE NSA.

Right.

WHERE DID MCCONNELL GO?

He retired and went into civilian life. He does various types of security work. That’s where an ex-NSA guy goes.

Bill Hamilton Note: “According to Dan, the officer he reported to was then Vice Adm. J.M. McConnell who was recently the Director of NSA.  He is now retired into civilian life.
Vice Adm. J. M. McConnell, Director, National Security Agency (NSA), 1992 to 1996.
Vice Adm. J. M. McConnell, Director, National Security Agency (NSA), 1992 to 1996.

Mr. McConnell joined Booz·Allen in March 1996 after serving as Director, National Security Agency (NSA), the agency responsible for Signals Intelligence and for all Classified Information Security for the U.S. Government. In addition to serving as Director of NSA, a position he held from 1992 to 1996, Mr. McConnell served as the Intelligence Officer for the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS-J2) during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Operation DESERT STORM. While serving on the Joint Staff, Mr. McConnell regularly briefed the President and his Cabinet Officers, international leaders, and the Senate and House of the U.S. Congress. He also appeared regularly on international television as the U.S. Intelligence Spokesman during the Gulf War. He achieved the rank of Vice Admiral in the U.S. Navy, where he spent more than 25 years as an Operational Intelligence Officer.”

ANY FINAL WORDS FROM EITHER OF THESE MEN CONCERNING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN 2003 AND NINE YEARS LATER IN 2012?

No, I haven’t. I’ve asked Dan directly what he thought might happen and he said he doesn’t know. All he could tell me was that from what he had learned ­ and again, it wasn’t first hand knowledge. I guess it was just something that he read from documents, that EBE 3 was scheduled to return in 2003 because they followed this nine year cycle that was somehow important to them. Like there were nine craft in the mountain. This number nine is somehow significant to them.

2012 is the termination point of another 9 year cycle. So, we’re going according to their cycle of nine, according to Dan.

But other than that return and renewal of this agreement they have, he did not know what else is planned. Although I have heard from another source that one of the things that is planned is possibly an announcement made by either members of the United Nations or leaders of religion, that there are extraterrestrials here.

Again, I have no way of evaluating ­ this is stuff that has kind of flown around and don’t know if it’s misinformation or really is an acclimatization program underway. If there is, why is there ­ I don’t know.

IF THERE IS A CYCLE OF NINE, IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT TAKES TO GO FROM WHEREVER THEY ARE TO WHEREVER WE ARE.

Yes. I don’t know what it’s tied to, except it’s tied to some kind of system they have, some kind of system that they pay attention to that deals with cycles of time.

THEY CYCLE IN AND OUT OF THE EARTH EVERY NINE YEARS?

I don’t know how to answer that, except that EBE 3 left nine years ago in 1994.


Mars and Blond Humanoids

DID EITHER DAN OR BILL UHOUSE TALK ABOUT HAVING KNOWLEDGE SPECIFICALLY OF THE J-ROD SPECIES HAVING BASES UNDERGROUND ON MARS?

No. However, Dan mentioned another type of being who was on Mars, but went elsewhere. Their home is not there. Their home is close to Epsilon Orionis. These are described as the tall blonds, the Nordic types. But he has never met one, he’s just read about them.

DAN BURISCH HAS READ ABOUT THE BLONDS IN HIS WORK IN THE PAPOOSE MOUNTAINS?

Yes.

DID HE CHARACTERIZE ANYTHING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TALL BLONDS AND THE J-ROD TYPE?

They are just another branch that has evolved from Homo sapiens, but they went along the spiritual evolutionary path, according to him.

SO, DAN BURISCH SEES ANY EXTRATERRESTRIAL INVOLVEMENT WITH EARTH NOW AS VARIOUS BLOODLINE BRANCHES FROM HOMO SAPIENS AND THEY ARE BACK HERE BECAUSE OF SOME TERRIBLE PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE?

Yes. But he admitted to me that his knowledge of extraterrestrial races is limited, very limited. the only extraterrestrial entity that he encountered was this J-Rod. He said he believes that there are other races out there. In fact, I have two independent sources which have mentioned the figures 167 and 169, so close together. I thought this was highly coincidental.

OF VARIOUS TYPES OF SPECIES OR CIVILIZATIONS?

Yes.

WAS THERE ANY CHARACTERIZATION BY DAN BURISCH OF THE GOVERNMENT’S RELATIONSHIP TO THE TALL BLONDS?

No, he was not privy to that information. He had no need to know.

IF THE BLONDS WERE ON MARS ONCE, WHERE DID THEY GO AND WHY DID THEY LEAVE?

They went to Epsilon Orionis and I don’t know why. (Middle star in Orion’s Belt)

THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. HOW FAR IS THAT FROM ZETA RETICULII I AND II?

I haven’t looked that up.

 

How Could EBE J-Rods and Blond Humanoids Change Earth’s Time Line?

CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHATEVER DAN BURISCH’S UNDERSTANDING IS ABOUT THE CYCLES OF TIME AND HOW BEINGS THAT WERE SOME EXTENSION OF HOMO SAPIENS BLOOD LINES FAR IN THE FUTURE COULD COME BACK AND TRY TO CHANGE OUR PRESENT TIME LINES?

About the only thing he said was that he understood that the Nordic Blonds and these J-Rods met and had decided they were going to attempt to change their history because they had now learned how to travel in time and travel backwards in time to some point that I would estimate is in our distant past. (Or 2012?) Again, we’re talking about this fantastic subject of time travel and what it does to reality. And it’s very complicated. A lot of scientists have toyed with these ideas and the paradoxes it presents. What I have studied are anecdotal stories of people who have found themselves some how displaced into the past. This is something not studied by the scientists, because they are always talking faster than light travel, worm holes, the theory of relativity, and that kind of time travel, using a time machine of some kind.

But I’m talking about a spontaneous paraphysical events that happen to people that they report. An event would be like someone decides to go on a vacation with their entire family. They stop at a restaurant and everything in the restaurant ­ people are dressed like way back in the 1950s. The service is great, the food is great. Then the bill comes and it’s only maybe $10 or $12 for six of them. And they go ‘Huh? How can this be?’ They happily pay it and leave and decide to return on a trip to that same restaurant and find out there is no restaurant. Rumor has it there was a restaurant there 20 years ago and it burned to the ground. Well, what happened?! I mean, their recollection is that they had this physical happening.

RIGHT, AND IT IS AS IF THERE ARE THESE THREADS WOVEN JUST LIKE WE WOULD THINK OF A BRAID WITH ALL OF THESE MULTIPLE PIECES OF HAIR, EACH HAIR BEING A TIME LINE. WHAT INTRIGUES ME IS: IF YOU REACH A POINT IN TECHNOLOGY WHERE YOU CAN MATCH OR EXCEED THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND BEGIN TO MOVE IN TIME, WHAT CAN YOU ACCOMPLISH BY COMING BACK INTO YOUR DISTANT PAST, WHICH IS WHAT THESE NON-HUMANS ARE SAYING THEY ARE DOING NOW ­ IN ORDER TO AVERT A CATASTROPHE IN THE FUTURE? HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

I don’t know. But they have knowledge of what happens. They have greater knowledge and apparently, they have a plan. That’s the only thing I can think of. They have a plan in which they are going to try to change something and interfere with our time line so as to avert a catastrophe.

HAS DAN BURISCH SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AS BEING INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH ALL OF THESE EFFORTS OF CHANGING TIME LINES?

No, he has not.

WE COULD BE SITTING ON THE PRECIPICE OF SOME KIND OF NUCLEAR WAR IN AND AROUND IRAQ WHICH COULD SOME HOW BE GERMANE TO EVERYTHING WE’RE TALKING ABOUT?

That’s a possibility I cannot dismiss. We all have more questions than the answers that have been supplied so far, I know that. I still have questions.

DID DAN BURISCH HIMSELF SEEM TO BE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT IT ALL MEANT?

He did not seem to be totally knowledgeable. This was all something he said he read in briefing documents and could discuss occasionally with some of his fellow workers. It wasn’t like he had any direct knowledge of the whole scheme of things. He would state that it fascinates him, but can only discuss with any certainty those things he has direct knowledge about in his work.”

Bill Uhouse: “I spent 10 years in the Marine Corps, and four years working with the Air Force as a civilian doing experimental testing on aircraft since my Marine Corps days. I was a pilot in the service, and a fighter pilot; [I] fought in after the latter part of WWII and the Korean War Conflict, I was discharged as a Captain in the Marine Corps.

“I didn’t start working on flight simulators until about – well the year was 1954, in September. After I got out of the Marine Corps, I took a job with the Air Force at Wright Patterson doing experimental flight-testing on various different modifications of aircraft.

“While I was at Wright Patterson, I was approached by an individual who – and I’m not going to mention his name – [wanted] to determine if I wanted to work in an area on new creative devices. Okay? And, that was a flying disc simulator. What they had done: they had selected several of us, and they reassigned me to A-Link Aviation, which was a simulator manufacturer. At that time they were building what they called the C-11B, and F-102 simulator, B-47 simulator, and so forth. They wanted us to get experienced before we actually started work on the flying disc simulator, which I spent 30-some years working on.

“I don’t think any flying disc simulators went into operation until the early 1960s – around 1962 or 1963. The reason why I am saying this is because the simulator wasn’t actually functional until around 1958. The simulator that they used was for the extraterrestrial craft they had, which is a 30-meter one that crashed in Kingman, Arizona, back in 1953 or 1952. That’s the first one that they took out to the test flight.

“This ET craft was a controlled craft that the aliens wanted to present to our government – the U.S.A. It landed about 15 miles from what used to be an army air base, which is now a defunct army base. But that particular craft, there were some problems with: number one – getting it on the flatbed to take it up to Area 51. They couldn’t get it across the dam because of the road. It had to be barged across the Colorado River at the time, and then taken up Route 93 out to Area 51, which was just being constructed at the time. There were four aliens aboard that thing, and those aliens went to Los Alamos for testing.

“They set up Los Alamos with a particular area for those guys, and they put certain people in there with them – people that were astrophysicists and general scientists – to ask them questions. The way the story was told to me was: there was only one alien that would talk to any of these scientists that they put in the lab with them. The rest wouldn’t talk to anybody, or even have a conversation with them. You know, first they thought it was all ESP or telepathy, but you know, most of that is kind of a joke to me, because they actually speak – maybe not like we do – but they actually speak and converse. But there was only one who would [at Los Alamos].

“The difference between this disc, and other discs that they had looked at was that this one was a much simpler design. The disc simulator didn’t have a reactor, [but] we had a space in it that looked like the reactor that wasn’t the device we operated the simulator with. We operated it with six large capacitors that were charged with a million volts each, so there were six million volts in those capacitors. They were the largest capacitors ever built. These particular capacitors, they’d last for 30 minutes, so you could get in there and actually work the controls and do what you had to – to get the simulator, the disc to operate.

“So, it wasn’t that simple, because we only had 30 minutes. Okay? But, in the simulator you’ll notice that there are no seat belts. Right? It was the same thing with the actual craft – no seat belts. You don’t need seat belts, because when you fly one of these things upside down, there is no upside down like in a regular aircraft – you just don’t feel it. There’s a simple explanation for that: you have your own gravitational field right inside the craft, so if you are flying upside down – to you – you are right side up. I mean, it’s just really simple, if people would look at it. I was inside the actual alien craft for a start-up.

“There weren’t any windows. The only way we had any visibility at all was done with cameras or video-type devices. [See the testimony of Mark McClandlish. SG] My specialty was the flight deck and the instruments on the flight deck. I knew about the gravitational field and what it took to get people trained.

“Because the disc has its own gravitational field, you would be sick or disoriented for about two minutes after getting in, after it was cranked up. It takes a lot of time to become used to it. Because of the area and the smallness of it, just to raise your hand becomes complicated. You have to be trained – trained with your mind, to accept what you are going to actually feel and experience.
Just moving about is difficult, but after a while you get used to it and you do it – it’s simple. You just have to know where everything is, and you [have] to understand what’s going to happen to your body. It’s no different than accepting the g-forces when you are flying an aircraft or coming out of a dive. It’s a whole new ball game.

“Each engineer that had anything to do with the design was part of the start-up crew. We would have to verify all the equipment that we put in – be sure it [worked] like it [was] supposed to, etc.
I’m sure our crews have taken these craft out into space. I’m saying it probably took a while to train enough of the people, over a sufficient time period. The whole problem with the disc is that it is so exacting in its design and so forth. It can’t be used like we use aircraft today, with dropping bombs and having machine guns in the wings.

“The design is so exacting, that you can’t add anything – it’s got to be just right. There’s a big problem in the design of where things are put. Say, where the center of the aircraft is, and that type of thing. Even the fact that we raised it three feet so the taller guys could get in – the actual ship was extended back to its original configuration, but it has to be raised.

“We had meetings, and I ended up in a meeting with an alien. I called him J-ROD – of course, that’s what they called him. I don’t know if that was his real name or not, but that’s the name the linguist gave him. I did draw a sketch, before I left, of him in a meeting. I provided it to some people and that was my impression of what I saw, an art picture of an alien that is working in cooperation with earth-people as told here.

“The alien used to come in with [Dr. Edward] Teller and some of the other guys, occasionally, to handle questions that maybe we’d have. But you have to understand that everything was specific to the group. If it wasn’t specific to the group, you couldn’t talk about it. It was on a need-to-know basis. And [the ET], he’d talk. He would talk, but he’d sound just like as if you spoke – he’d sound like you. You know, he’s like a parrot, but he’d try and answer your question. A lot of times he’d have a hard time understanding, because if you didn’t put it on paper and explain yourself, half the time he couldn’t give you a good answer.

“The preparation we had before meeting this alien was, basically, going through all of the different nationalities in the world. Then they got into going into other forms of life, even down to animals and that type of thing. And this J-ROD – his skin was pinkish, but a little bit rough – that kind of stuff; not horrible-looking, you know – or to me, he wasn’t horrible-looking.

“Some of the guys who were in the particular group that I was in – they never even made it. You know, when they gave you the psychological questions, I just answered them the way I felt and I had no problem. That’s what they wanted to know – if you’d become upset – but it never bothered me. It didn’t amount to much.

“So basically, the alien was only giving engineering advice and science advice. For example, I performed the calculations but needed more help. I spoke of a book that – well it’s not a book; it’s a big assembly with various divisions dealing with gravitational technology, and the key elements are in there, but all the information wasn’t there. Even our top mathematicians couldn’t figure some of this stuff out, so the alien would assist.

“Sometimes you’d get into a spot where you [would] try and try and try, and it wouldn’t work. And that’s when he’d [the alien] come in. They would tell him to look at this and see what we did wrong.
Over the last 40 years or so, not counting the simulators – I’m talking about actual craft – there are probably two or three-dozen, and various sizes that we built.

“I don’t know much about the [ET] ones that they brought here. I know about that one [craft] out of Kingman but that’s about it. And, I know the company that hauled it out of there – who is out here now – but But, there’s one that operates with certain chemicals.

“I think these triangles that people are seeing are two or three 30-meter craft, that are in the center of it [the triangle]. And, the outside perimeter – well you could put anything you want, as long as these particular ones meet the design criteria, and they’ll operate.

“You know, there were certain reasons for the secrecy. I could understand that; it was no different than the first atomic bomb that they built. But they are getting so far ahead now with aircraft design. And, like I told you gentlemen earlier – that by 2003, most of this stuff will be out for everybody to look at. Maybe not the way that everybody expects it, but in some manner they determine appropriate to show everybody. You know, a big surprise.

“The reason why I said that is because the document I signed ends in 2003 and I’m not the only one who signed those. But, that gravitational manual – if you ever get one of these volumes of documents, you’d be on top of the world. You’d know everything.”
