# Jack Sarfatti

Physicist and contactee.

Claims that the UFOnauts are time travellers.

Franc Milburn 
> Dr. Sarfatti says the technology behind the Tic-Tac UFO (2004 Nimitz
incident) is not mysterious at all: it folds space into a warp drive in such
a way as to get to where and when it desires with tiny amounts of energy.
Sarfatti claims we can build our own Tic-Tacs quickly and that it would
be in Americaâ€™s best interests to do so, as Russia already has a head start.
Such spacecraft would render all our conventional weapons obsolete, he
explains, particularly if the warp capacity were weaponized.

time travel to the past, instant travel to moon, Mars, stars."
