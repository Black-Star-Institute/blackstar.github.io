# Chi'el'ah

[Dan Burisch](burisch_dan.md) claimed to have befriended a P-52 J-ROD (future human) named Chi'el'ah who was imprisoned at Area 51 in the S-4/5 site in the Papoose Lake facility. His reference number was EBE-
53AZ2, where EBE stands for Extraterrestrial Biological Entity.

Chi'el'ah purportedly was one of the two surviving pilots from the crash of a craft in 1953 at Kingman, Arizona.

Can the details of the Kingman, AZ 1953 crash be confirmed?

The description of the P-52 J-ROD matches that of the Varginha 1994 being. It matches up with Bill Uhouse's prior testimony.
