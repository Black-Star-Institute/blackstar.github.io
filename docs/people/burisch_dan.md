# Education

Burisch claimed that he studied at university but didn't graduate normally.

> Sixty-one creditors are listed which include ten student loans in the years 1997 to 2000 and two years listed as 1977, totaling $14,248. It is not known if the “1977s” are typos. Danny B Crain was 13 years old in 1977. Bill Hamilton raises the question, “If these are student loans for Dan Burisch, what school/s has he attended and what subjects has he taken?

# Bankruptcy filing

Linda Moulton Howe, *Earthfiles* [The Chapter 7 Bankruptcy of Dan and Deborah Burisch](https://www.earthfiles.com/2004/07/13/the-chapter-7-bankruptcy-of-dan-and-deborah-burisch/), 2004

Moulton Howe
> Chapter 7 bankruptcy was signed on July 16, 2002, and received and filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court on July 19, 2002. This is a public record.

[Marcia McDowell](mcdowell_marcia.md) stated:
> Marcia McDowell said, “Dan has not worked for the U. S. government like people think of a government scientist. There are no paychecks involved, no 401-K’s and matching funds and retirement. There is nothing like that. He works for Majestic-12 (MJ).
> They take care of him. But they don’t micro-manage the messiness of lives. Chapter 7 and other bankruptcy options can be used as tools by MJ without leaving a paper trail that incriminates them.

# Stolen valour claims

According to [Jeremy Rys](https://alienscientist.com/burisch.html):

> Vietnam Veteran and actual former Area 51 Employee Edgar Fouche worked with a few ex Navy Seals to file "Stolen Valor" charges against Dan "Burisch" Crain, subsequently prompting Dan to remove nearly 80% of his videos and other online materials from the web to avoid being charged and court martialed.
