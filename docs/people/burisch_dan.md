# Stolen valour claims

According to [Jeremy Rys](https://alienscientist.com/burisch.html):

> Vietnam Veteran and actual former Area 51 Employee Edgar Fouche worked with a few ex Navy Seals to file "Stolen Valor" charges against Dan "Burisch" Crain, subsequently prompting Dan to remove nearly 80% of his videos and other online materials from the web to avoid being charged and court martialed.
