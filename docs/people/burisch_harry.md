# Harry Burisch

Harry Ernest Burisch (11th April 1933&ndash;6th August 2000) seems to have been the father of [Deborah Burisch](burisch_deborah.md), who is [Dan Burisch's](burisch_dan.md) first wife and suspected [Majestic Twelve](../organisations/mj12.md) member.

[Marcia McDowell](mcdowell_marcia.md) stated [Hamilton page 226] in her [email of 10th August 2004](mcdowell_marcia/2004_ufo_magazine_email.txt) that Harry is the name of Deborah's father.

>Deborah Burisch, *Harry (her father)*, Doreen Crain (Dan´s mother) and John Crain (Dan´s father) were in the audience that day. Everybody stiffened up visibly. The big guys who had their hands crossed over their suit jackets and kept staring at Dan (security personnel) were poised on a knife-edge in case Dan said the wrong thing.

"Family ties" to [James Forrestal](forrestal_james.md)? What does this mean? Did he marry the daughter of [James Huffman](huffman_james.md) in Las Vegas in c. 1982? It's coincidental that Harry married Nadean in Roanoke, Virginia, which is the same place that [Herman](mottley_herman.md) & [Doris Mottley](huffman_doris.md) lived.

## Military service

His obituary says he was a Navy veteran in the Korean War (1950&ndash;1953). I can't find any record of this. There are records for Horst K Burisch and [Victor Alfred Burisch](https://aad.archives.gov/aad/record-detail.jsp?dt=893&mtch=1&cat=GP23&tf=F&q=burisch&bc=sl&rpp=10&pg=1&rid=2915257), but not Harry Ernest.
