> This will give you a very small clue of what is coming next year. For instance, a certain neurophysiologist now has doubts, but before my account gained any traction... well... read for yourself. Further, the Aviary, now spouting disinformation about a non-existent place called Serpo, has a now deceased acquaintance named Tom Mack. Tom, a vetted person from Groom Lake by the same group just mentioned, saw me at Papoose and confirmed it in a letter before his death. We have the letter.

Tom Mack apparently [sent a letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvExIwUwNuU&list=PLWyjjDS38dGmvphTIWTwFgHg7ChKpQlBs&t=4406s) to Richard Doty on 2nd April 1999 confirming [Crain's](burisch_dan.md) role in [Project Aquarius](../projects/aquarius.md).
