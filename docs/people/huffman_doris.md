# Doris Huffman

Doris Ann Huffman AKA Burisch AKA Mottley (née Huffman) was born on 13th January 1941 in Roanoke, Virginia, USA.

She was the daughter of James Hafford Huffman, who may have been a courier for Majestic 12. Was James Huffman and friend of Secretary James Forrestal?

She married Herman Maxie Mottley in 1961.

She had a daughter named [Deborah Kay Mottley](mottley_deborah.md) who was born on 30th June 1961.

There is a [record](https://www.ancestry.co.uk/discoveryui-content/view/93994757:1788) of Doris A. Burisch in 1982 who was also born in January 1941. Is this the same woman, who married Harry Ernest Burisch in Las Vegas?
