# Deborah Burisch

Married [Dan Burisch (Crain)](burisch_dan.md) in the 1990s.

What happened to her since? Has she ever gone on the record?

# Suspected agent

Was she involved in covering up Dan's records?

[Garner 2008] implies his marriage was arranged while he worked at a parole officer in Las Vegas.

> He met the unlikely woman whom he would marry. There is
some reason to believe that she was a "plant" so that the powers that be might
better keep an eye on his private life
