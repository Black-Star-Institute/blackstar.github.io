Was she involved in covering up Dan's records?

[Garner 2008] implies his marriage was arranged while he worked at a parole officer in Las Vegas.

> He met the unlikely woman whom he would marry. There is
some reason to believe that she was a "plant" so that the powers that be might
better keep an eye on his private life

# Cover job

According to [Linda Moulton Howe](https://www.earthfiles.com/2004/07/13/the-chapter-7-bankruptcy-of-dan-and-deborah-burisch/)'s investigation:

> Bill Hamilton also understood that Deborah Burisch worked for the U. S. government as Dan’s government “handler,” a person assigned to monitor Burisch’s microbiology work, while maintaining her “cover job” as PBX Operator at the Mirage casino.

Casino worker 1990&ndash;2004. [Howe](https://www.earthfiles.com/2004/07/13/the-chapter-7-bankruptcy-of-dan-and-deborah-burisch/)

>  Deborah Burisch is listed as “PBX Operator” at the Mirage casino for 12 years in July 2002, or fourteen years by July 2004.

> Dan had told Bill Hamilton that his wife, Deborah, also worked with him in his classified government project, but she had a “cover job” in a Las Vegas casino.
> How could these two people be filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 16, 2002, and simultaneously be working for a classified U. S. government project?
