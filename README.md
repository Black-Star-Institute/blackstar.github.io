# Black Star Institute

This repository contains research notes regarding the UFO phenomenon and the purported cover up, focussing on the [Dan Crain (Burisch)](./docs/people/burisch_dan.md) testimony.

To get started, browse the [docs](./docs/) folder.

I plan to convert these documents into a nice website at some point in the future. For now, all the important information is contained within [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/#what-is-markdown) files within this repository.
